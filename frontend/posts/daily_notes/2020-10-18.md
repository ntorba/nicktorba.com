### Technologically Blinded
- There is a specific entrepreneurial skillset that it seems young people like me, specifically those who code, ignore - networks. Many programmers love the "build it and they will come" type fantasy. Or "good technology will sell itself." Unfortunately for us, both of those are wrong. 
- [[Elon Musk]] is a great example of how important networks are. His engineering skill did not make him successful. His ability to build insanely strong teams did.
- For those who have seen [[Peaky Blinders]], [[Tommy Shelby]] is a great example of how important a strong network is. Throughout the show, he barely stays alive through many series of dangerous occurrences. Whenever he has a particularly clever plan of action, it always involves a new set of people, often who have a large amount of power. His real skill isn't the action they show, it's his ability to continually expand his network to more powerful people (while also keeping many of his relationships to those people a secret). Tommy is a clear example of how important relationships are to success. 
- The blinding comes to those who think they can make it on their own through raw intelligence or creativity. If you take a look around, it's clear there's much more to it than that. It certainly helps, but it won't complete the puzzle.
