- ## Weekly Review
    - This is the end of my first full week public daily note making. Here are the trends from this this week
        - People who inspire me are in large part great writers. Some examples who I've been reading/listening to lately
            - [[Tim Ferris]] Long time favorite
            - [[Ben Hardy]] Long time favorite. Building [[future self]]
            - [[Salman Ansari]] Recent find with great newsletter. Great motivation to write
            -  [[David Perrell]] Recent find motivating writing. Really emphasizes the power of writing. Mostly listen his podcast [[The North Star]]
        - We have a an intense relationship with time that is not consistent throughout humanity [[2020-10-19]]
        - [[interface first design]]. [[Begin with the end in mind]] design [[2020-10-20]]
        - Internet incentives. People have a lot to gain from helping others [[2020-10-21]]
        - **My personal favorite from this week**: Teach me how to Google [[2020-10-22]]
            - [My Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/nicktorba/status/1319252464743448576?s=20)
            - Can googling be taught directly? How quickly can we accelerate the learning of this skill?
        - [[AI Data Landscape]] and [[MLOps]] continue to get more blog posts about what's currently happening. Block continues to be hot [[2020-10-23]]
        - Businesses don't care about cool software, they care about increasing revenue and reducing costs [[2020-10-24]] [[Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice]] 
    - Other cool things from this week:
        - I found [[Andy Matuschak]] [notes page](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) which on one hand I find really cool, but I also found it pretty annoying to navigate at first. When you hover over a link, a little window pops up, but if you move your mouse it disappears, even if you try to move your mouse over the window. Not cool
            - Once I got used to that, I still found it cool, but there is too a little too much going on for me to be able to really focus on the information. 
        - I saw that [[Salman Ansari]] uses [[Obsidian]], which looks like a great tool, comparable to [[Roam]]. Here's a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/gsve57/roam_research_vs_obsidian/) in some ways
            - great editor for taking notes in markdown that get translated to this site
        - Started reading [[Getting To Yes]] after reading [[Don't Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice]]
            - A note I liked: "Give them a stake in the outcome by making sure they participate in the process. If they are not involved in the process, they are unlikely to approve the product" pg. 29
                - Getting someone to do what you want is easiest when they want the same thing. 
                - very applicable to the [[opensource]] space and collaboration in general. Everyone wants their own stake, just like you 
        - I also found a company I think it really cool [[Latacora]] from [[Patrick Mackenzie]]'s website
            - Their business model is really interesting, and they are going after a really important, really hard, and **really boring** problem
            - A great example of a [[migraine problem]]
        - I saw [[Anish Shah]] this week! First time in over 6 months
