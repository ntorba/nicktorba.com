### Where's the Real Power? 
- For those who have seen [[Peaky Blinders]], [[Tommy Shelby]] is a great example of how important a strong [[social network]] is. Throughout the show, he barely stays alive through many series of dangerous events. Whenever he has a particularly clever plan of action, it always involves a new set of people, often who have a large amount of power. His real skill isn't the action they show, it's his ability to continually expand his network to more powerful people (while also keeping many of his relationships to those people a secret). Tommy is a clear example of how important relationships are to success. 
- [[Elon Musk]] is a great real world example of a strong network. His engineering skill did not make him successful. His ability to build insanely talented teams did.
- This is a skillset that young people who code ignore. Many programmers love the "build it and they will come" type fantasy. Or "good technology will sell itself." Unfortunately for us, both of those are wrong. 
- The blinding comes to those who think they can make it on their own through raw intelligence or creativity. If you take a look around, it's clear there's much more to it than that. It certainly helps, but it won't complete the puzzle.
