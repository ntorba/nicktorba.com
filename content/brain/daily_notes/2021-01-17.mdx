Weekly reviews are where I aggregate the best of my week. My goal is to make my information consumption more active, while sharing interesting ideas, articles, podcasts, and videos with others.

This week I wrote about a lesson I learned in high school and how I'm applying it now, updated empty notes I linked to [last week](https://nicktorba.com/brain/2021-01-10), talk about the new [[Idea Queue]], and share some notes on [[Balajis.com]].

## [[Skills beat Fitness]]
If you only read one thing from this review, it should be [this](/brain/skills-beat-fitness). I talk about the most important lesson I learned from years of training for baseball - **Skills beat Fitness** - and how I am using that lesson now.

This is the closest thing I've written to an essay on this site so far. For now, I'm thinking of it as a "long-form note."

## [[Things You Should Never Do, Part 1]]
[Last Week](https://nicktorba.com/brain/2021-01-10), I linked to [[Things You Should Never Do, Part 1]] without having added any notes to the page! I updated it this week with notes from the original article by [[Joel Spolsky]]. It's about a fundamental law of programming and the effects it has on code bases everywhere. 

## [[Idea Queue]]

The [[Idea Queue]] is a new page where I'm going to keep a list of future ideas I want to work on. This list will constantly change, and at no point do I feel obligated to follow through with any of them, but I thought sharing those ideas would be a fun way for people to give feedback before I even start working on them. 

## [[balajis.com]]
One idea on the [[Idea Queue]] is [[Imaginary Podcast Preparation]]. The plan is to build notes on individuals as if I were going to have them on a podcast. This week, I started to compile notes from [[balajis.com]]. 

For now, this page just has a collection of notes on ideas I've first learned about from Balaji. 

**My favorite note from Balaji** so far is  [[How to Gradually Exit Twitter]]. 

Some others include
- [[progress is abstraction]]
- [[Idea Maze]]

## [[explainability threshold]]
Last week, I wrote about my notes on how I differentiate between [[complicated vs complex]] ideas. This week, I added quick thoughts on how I think about a new term - your [[explainability threshold]]. 


## Article of the Week - [[Seeing Like An Algorithm]] 

This articles explores some ideas behind the For You Page on [[TikTok]] and why it is so effective. The main point is [[Algorithm Friendly Design]], which is a concept that designs an app with algorithms in mind from the start. This enables the creation of huge datasets meant for training machine learning algorithms with a specific business driven purpose.  

This is also what originally led me to [[A Big Little Idea Called Legibility]]. 

My main takeaways from this article after reading were: 

- Most apps we use today are at their limits of good reccomendations because of constraints on design and lack of signal from users on specific pieces of content
- [[Algorithm Friendly Design]] is going to become a design pillar for all future large scale apps. It will need to be baked in from the start so future companies are not limited by the current constraints for making good recommendations faced by platforms like twitter, facebook, yelp, etc.  


## Final Thoughts 
I leaned into action this week. Instead of putting off notes pages, I decided to publish them even if I don't think they were very clean. It felt good to push a lot of new notes.
