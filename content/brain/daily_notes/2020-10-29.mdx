# Vertical Farming
Yesterday, I randomly opened up the book [[2030]] to a chapter about [[vertical farming]]. Vertical farming is agriculture meant for cities, where farms spread up in warehouses, instead of out over fields. They are pioneering new agriculture techniques, touting more efficient use of  water, soil, and light because of the precision available in the warehouse environment. 
[[sky greens]], in particular, is very innovative. From their hydraulic water pulley system, to the their "Proprietary cold chain management system", they make vertical farming look like the future. [This article](https://www.ecowatch.com/worlds-first-hydraulic-driven-vertical-farm-produces-1-ton-of-vegetabl-1882095600.html) even says "Sky Greens' four-story rotating greenhouse produces 1 ton of leafy greens every other day" which is insane. 1 ton? What does that much spinach even look like? 
The hydraulic pulley system is explained here:

The hydraulic tower is ingenious. Power the pulley with the same water that is nourishing the plants while also evenly distributing sunlight. However, this does require an environment with great year round weather, unlike some other vertical farming warehouses that use artificial light.

# [[Getting To Yes]] Disentangle the People from the problems
- Be on the same side of the problem (figuratively and litterally, if you physically at a table, get on the same side). 
- If you can frame your issue as you both solving a problem together, and not facing each other as the problem, your situation lends itself to becoming much more constructive. This works best by having a good working relationship with the other party, which is best established before the negociation
    - [[Benjamin Franklin]] used to ask to borrow a book from the other party, which is a pleasant way to start a relationship 
    - Think about negotiating with your roommates on washing the dishes. Instead of thinking of it in terms of you vs. your roommate, it's both of you against the dishes. 


# #watchlist [[codesandbox]] [goes open source](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client). 
This is an awesome idea. It greatly reduces friction in the development process. Beginners and advanced programmers alike spend hours fiddling with dependency and environment management. Leaving that behind allows for more focus on the creative problem.
