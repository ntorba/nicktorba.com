I have two main reasons for creating this site. 

First, there is a world of opportunity passing me by. I've passively engaged with the web for years. I read great newsletters, I like my twitter feed, I listen to good podcasts. I constantly consume, but where's it all go? I like to think it makes me smarter, but if I don't use the information to produce, is that really true? Becoming part of the massive online creation machine that is the internet has always felt out of reach. I could never think of good tweets. I didn't have anything "original" to write about. I'm not interesting enough. Those thoughts kept me stuck. This site is my attempt to get unstuck. It's time to put my consumption to use and add to all work I've consumed for years. My hope is that publicly sharing interesting ideas will lead to better writing and better understanding of the subjects I write about. 

Second, I want to increase my exposure to new people and ideas. And as I wrote about on [[October 18th, 2020]], I've grossly underrated how important a strong network is. I've listened to too many podcasts and read too many blog posts about the serendipitous magic that can happen as the result of ideas and content shared online. Not taking advantage of the opportunity to improve my own thinking while also finding new ideas and connections is a massive regret waiting to happen. 

With that said, if you're ever intrigued by any of my writing, please reach out on Twitter with the link at the bottom of this page! I'd love to hear from you!
