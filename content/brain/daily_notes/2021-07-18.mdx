## [[How Much Do We Work]]
- [[Noah Pinion]] made a claim in [[Bidenonmics Explained]] about hours worked by Americans that I disagree with. I wrote the note [[How Much Do We Work]] to explain why. Let me know what you think! 

## [[Dynamic Land]]
Through [[Dominic Cummings]] [blog](https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/), I found [[Dynamic Land]] this week, which is a really cool project co-founded by [[Bret Victor]] and [[Alan Kay]]. 

Their long term vision: 
    
```2060: The dynamic medium, everywhere,Â built into all infrastructure as electric lighting is today. As a non-profit, we are free and obligated to do whatever it takes to ensure that this pervasive medium is safe and empowers all people, rather than prioritizing corporate or nefarious interests.```

What I forgot to include, though, is that they want their [[Tony Stark]]-like labs to be publicly available (like libraries) - not just the rich who can afford them. 

The [[dynamic medium]] allows us to "think as whole humans." By turning the computer into a whole room/building/space, we can interact with our full bodies, not just our eyes and fingers. 

## [[Bret Victor]]
- After finding [[DynamicLand]], I returned to Bret's awesome [personal website](http://worrydream.com/#). It's not like any other site on the internet. He flexes his great UI understanding while showing off all of his great projects. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every time I end up on Bret Victor&#39;s personal website I get more impressed <a href="https://t.co/vsdmr9xpls">https://t.co/vsdmr9xpls</a></p>&mdash; Nick Torba (@nicktorba) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicktorba/status/1417463221276000256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

- I plan to spend more time reading and watching videos about his work, as well as [[Alan Kay]].
