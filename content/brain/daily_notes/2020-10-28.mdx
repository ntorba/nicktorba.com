- Are books documentation for life, or the software packages themselves? 
    - I made a tweet about this:

On [[October 20th, 2020]], I wrote about [[Interface First Design]]. If books are software packages, then they are meant to provide specific functionality as part of a larger system. Like software, instead of building that functionality from scratch, we leverage the hard work of the author.  
If this analogy holds, then [[interface first design]] applies to books as well. Before, reading another book, spend 15 minutes designing an "api" new learnings from the book will build. 
- This gives you a framework to sort new information into, making it easier to create long term memories (maybe?) and connections
- It clarifies what skills/knowledge you expect to gain from the book and how you want to use it
- You get to see how good your predictions about the book were
- Writing book summaries as "code" could be a cool way to convey important information 
    - Could build out inhertiance hierarchies of books by genre, subject, topic, type
