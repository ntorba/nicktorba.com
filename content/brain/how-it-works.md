The Jungle is my [digital garden](https://salman.io/notes/digital-gardens/). The structure of the notes is inspired by [RoamResearch](https://roamresearch.com/)

Each page is a note on a topic. At the bottom of each page, you'll see a section titled **My Linked Notes**. This a list of all other notes that reference your current note. Pages link to other pages based on text enclosed in double brackets (like this: [[The Jungle]]). Click on them to go to that note.

My hope is to leave readers with open tabs and an an open mind.
