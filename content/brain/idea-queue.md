The Idea Queue is where I keep a list of different ideas I'm thinking about working on in the future.

## Writing Ideas

### [[Imaginary Podcast Preparation]] 
Take notes on individuals as if I were preparing to have them on a podcast (that does not exist)
- List of topics they are experts in/intereted in 
- List of questions I would like to ask 
- Any ideas on how some of their ideas could be extended
- What I find most interesting about them

The goal of this will be to force myself to engage more with ideas, instead of taking them at face value. Find points where their ideas could extend, or where I disagree, instead of passively reading/listening to them.  

Some initial targets:
- [[Kevin Kelly]]
- [[balajis.com]] 
- [[Salman Ansari]]
- [[David Perrell]]

### [[Introducing the Dweb]]
- Create a summary of the ideas and apps listed in [[Introducing the Dweb]] 
- Make recommendations for the best places to get started for people with different levels of technical comfortability 


### Make my Weekly Reviews a Newsletter 
Choose a platform and convert my [[Weekly Review]]s into a newsletter. 
I would like to submit it to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2dT6f8bO0gcWfgk3DrqHmJ7hq5Ukb4gtsdXAUbMoSX4ZpbQ/viewform) from [[How to Gradually Exit Twitter]]

- Put a lack of emphasis on quantity of subs, and high emphasis on quality of subs. I want to find people that will interact with the ideas 

### [[open source coaching]] [[Idea Maze]]
Create an Idea Maze for open source coaching idea. 

## Technical Ideas 
### [[RoamResarch Graph Topic Model]]
- Follow resources like [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/learn-nlp-the-practical-way-b854ce1035c4) and [this](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/finding-the-narrative-with-natural-language-processing-47177d20f743) to create cool visualizations and a topic model for my roam research graph 

- Create this visualization with each Weekly Review, possible on subsets of my notes, to keep track of how topics of interest are changing 

- Use [newspaper3k](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


### [[Pocket Model]]
Fine tune a named entity recognition model on my RoamResearch database to construct knowledge graphs out of articles in pocket

### [[Philly MTB Map]]
Create a map of Philly [[[[MTB]] Locations]] that I've aggregated from google searches and friends. I think a map view would be very helpful. I also haven't found a comprehensive list of all great locations in the area that aren't buried in some reddit thread or scatter throughout [mtbproject](https://www.mtbproject.com/).
