Continuing [[The Jungle]] metaphor, I call my favorite notes the "trailheads". These are the best entrances to the jungle. They link to notes to my recent writings, notes on books and articles, and more. You'll see that some of the notes don't even have writing on the page themselves, but instead have linked references to explore. That is part of the fun of this medium! 
Pick any one of them - you never know where it may lead. 

Some of these trails will be much more well built than others. Often, I'll put a note on this page as encouragement for myself to clean it up in the anticipation that others may see it soon. If you end up on a trail that looks like a mess, don't be afraid to help me build it (by reaching out on [twitter](http://twitter.com/nicktorba) and [email](mailto:nicholastorba@gmail.com)).
