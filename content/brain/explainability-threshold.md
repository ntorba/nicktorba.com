The explainability threshold is a person's capacity to explain any subject or phenomena. 

In relation to the image shown on the [[complicated vs complex]] page, when a subject's complexity surpasses a person's explainability threshold, that person's perception of the subject moves from complex (sophisticated yet explainable) to complicated (overwhelming and confusing).
