execution >= idea
- "That’s one of the reasons that the execution is prized over the idea: people will copy the idea as soon as the market is proved out"
    - Your idea can be great, but if it's really that good, it's going to be copied left and right 

Idea, Execution, and **Market** all play important factors in success of a startup
- The Market? [[Mark Andreeson]] is quoted from [here](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html): 
    - "Personally, I’ll take the third position – I’ll assert that market is the most important factor in a startup’s success or failure"

### Why?
In a great market – a market with lots of real potential customers – the market pulls product out of the startup. The market needs to be fulfilled and the market will be fulfilled, by the first viable product that comes along. The product doesn’t
need to be great; it just has to basically work. And, the market doesn’t care how good the team is, as long as the team can produce that viable product.
- Another great one from [[Mark Andreeson]]: 
    - "When a great team meets a lousy market, market wins. When a lousy team meets a great market, market wins. When a great team meets a great market, something special happens.

Instead of having a great idea, you need to find a great market, and let them pull the idea out for themselves. 

How do you go about building a good reputation in a new market? 

[[Execution Mindset]]
- "The most important tasks are those that get you to the maze
exit, or at least a treasure chest with some powerups"

- Find the [[One Thing]] that will get you to the end of the Maze
