- **Steal Like An Artist**
  - All the best artists find the ideas worth stealing.
  - No ideas are fully unique, everything is built on what comes before
  - Combining ideas creates more than the sum of its parts
  - Look for good quality inputs into your life. Don't let garbage in.
  - Don't just look at your favorite people, also look at their favorite people
  - Keep educating yourself, be curious about the world and draw from it
  - Keep a swipe file to store the best ideas you find. Capture quotes, designs, colors, and anything else worth stealing.
- **Don't Wait Until You Know Who You Are To Get Started**
  - You have to just start and find yourself as you go
  - Copy people you respect, try to emulate their work
  - Don't copy from a single individual, copy from many. This amalgamation of ideas will turn into your own unique voice.
- **Write The Book You Want To Read**
  - Don't just write about what you know, write about what you like
  - Try to write a sequel to all your favorites combined into one
  - Think about what your favorite people might have created if they worked together, and try to make that thing
- **Use Your Hands**
  - It is hard to unlock creative ideas solely in front of the computer
  - Setup a physical workstation for yourself. Use paper and scissors and tape and put the ideas together in visual ways.
  - Once the idea is set, move back to the computer to bring it to life
  - (How could I do this with programming? Maybe more paper prototyping? Designing system architectures and schemas on paper first?)
- **Side Projects And Hobbies Are Important**
  - Side projects allow for productive procrastination. Have projects you can switch between so that when you get bored of one you have a productive way to spent your time anyway
  - Take time to be bored, mess around, wander. It will lead to great insights.
  - Don't throw away interests. Pursue a variety of different things as hobbies or more. You won't know how it all connected together until you look back.
- **The Secret: Do Good Work And Share It With People**
  - College makes us feel like people care what we think, and that illusion is shattered the moment we enter the real world
  - "Enjoy your obscurity while it lasts. Use it"
  - Not-so-secret formula to being known: Do good work and share it with people
  - Practice and keeping working until you can do good work
  - Put things on the internet to share it
  - Get interested in things and share those interests, don't worry about keeping secrets, just share
  - Use the internet to develop ideas and evolve your process, keep publishing and improving, and allow your audience to hold you accountable
- **Geography Is No Longer Our Master**
  - We can find mentors anywhere in the world now
  - Build a community online, you aren't constrained to your location
  - Build a world around you that you enjoy
  - Find solitude for yourself. Bring a book, a notebook, and pen, and find a place to sit, think, and give yourself a bit of space and a bit of time
  - Sometimes you do need to leave home. You need to feel uncomfortable and train yourself to see the world differently.
  - Find a place with bad weather. It will force you to stay inside and work.
  - "You have to find a place that feeds you--creatively, socially, spiritually, and literally."
- **Be Nice. (The World Is A Small Town)**
  - Make friends on the internet, don't be mean, be nice instead
  - Spend time around people smarter than you. The people you follow should inspire you to be better.
  - "If you ever find that you're the most talented person in the room, find a new room"
  - Get angry as inspiration, but don't get in fights, instead channel that anger into getting shit done
  - "Complain about the way other people make software by making software" - Andre Torrez
  - Write public fan letters. Show appreciation for someone's work without doing it in a way that requires them to respond.
  - Don't look for external validation, it probably won't come, just keep busy doing work you want to do
  - Keep a [[praise file]]. Don't overuse it, but take advantage of when your work is noticed and people appreciate you, keep those things as a reminder for when times are tough
- **Be Boring. (It's The Only Way To Get Work Done)**
  - Take care of yourself. You need energy to be creative, so keep yourself healthy enough to have energy, and don't waste it being stupid.
  - Try to be good with money. Learn about it, set a budget, avoid debt.
  - Keep the day job. It will give you a routine, financial stability, and people around you to learn from.
  - A job takes away your time, but giving you a routine is really valuable. Take advantage of that, and use that routine to keep doing your work every single day.
  - Get a calendar and use it to stay on track. [[Don't Break The Chain]]
  - Keep a logbook of what you do every day. Don't worry about making it a journal of thoughts and feelings, just record where you go to lunch, the things you work on, and who you may have met up with.
  - Find the right person to marry. Find someone to keep you grounded and that improves and appreciates your life as a chaotic creative.
- **Creativity Is Subtraction**
  - Place constraints on yourself to get past paralysis of choice.
  - For creative work, limitations = freedom
  - The things left out of a piece of work can be what gives it character.
  - "In the end, creativity isn't just the things we put in, it's the things we choose to leave out"
