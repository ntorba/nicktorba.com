I refer to balajis.com by his domain name because of his thoughts on [[How to Gradually Exit Twitter]], which could be called something like "The Future of Twitter-like Online Interaction" 

My favorite Balaji ideas: 
- [[progress is abstraction]]
- [[Idea Maze]]
- [[Idea, Execution, and Market]] [link](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/startup/lecture_slides/lecture5-market-wireframing-design.pdf)

- [[The Purpose of Technology]]

- [[Full Stack Narrative]] from https://balajis.com/the-purpose-of-technology/
    - quote: "We need to correct that immediately, and start evangelizing technological progress with every word and action. To recognize that the purpose of technology is to transcend our limits, and to motivate everything we're doing with a sense of that purpose"
    - Balaji is pushing to build a media ecosystem for technical progressives, which starts at technical education, and moves forward to engineers and scientists, and everyone else with hard technical skills learning how to write, report, and publish their ideas for the future (positive ones ideally)
