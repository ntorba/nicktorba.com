If you've come this far, you've found my jungle. It is a growing body of public notes on anything I find interesting enough to write about. 

The creation of these notes is driven by my [[Weekly Reviews]]. Weekly reviews are where I gather my thoughts on the books, articles, and podcasts I consumed in the past week. Use the links below to see my recent reviews: 
* [[2021-02-07]]

## Trailheads 
Extending [[The Jungle]] metaphor, my "trailhead" notes are listed below. These are the best places to enter the jungle.

As you explore, do not be afraid to click away to other ideas linked in each note. The point is to go deep and find connections. 

Some notes are much more well built than others. Often, I'll publish a note as encouragement for myself to clean it up in the anticipation that others may see it soon. If you end up somewhere that looks like a mess, don't be afraid to help me build it (by reaching out on [twitter](http://twitter.com/nicktorba) and [email](mailto:nicholastorba@gmail.com)).
