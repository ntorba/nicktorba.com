Alex begins this article with a hunch: the "mingling-copying mechanism" that humans and many other animals use to operate in groups won't work on networks. 

He wrote code (which I hope he shares soon) that shows his hunch was right. Despite my initial surprise at first reading this, I certainly see how this could be the case. 

The mingling copying mechanism he describes is very similar to [[Mimetic Theory]], which I first read about in [Peter Thiel's Religion](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel/). It's a bit of an ironic connection, because that is an essay stroking a billionaire, the exact group that Alex argues is most affected by the defects of copying in large networks. It is interesting to point out that [[David Perrell]] does think that [[Peter Thiel]] is successful, in large part, because of his intentionally anti-mimetic lifestyle.

The ideas here are also closely related to those in [[The Power Paradox]], which has a great term for our obsession with successful individuals - [[narratives of exceptionalism]]. [[Dacher Keltner]] shares results from experiments in which less powerful people more likely to attribute success (of lack thereof) to an individual's environment, while more powerful people are likely to attribute success to an individual's "special gifts". More and more, I am starting appreciate environments over special individuals. It's starting to make me question my sources of inspiration, like The [[Tim Ferris]] Show and writing like Peter Thiel's Religion. 
- I do still think there is value in those, but this perspective helps me better evaluate which parts of these people I want to emulate. In particular, I like the idea of focusing on putting myself in similar environments more than trying to copy actions or attitudes 

I also enjoy arguments for positive change that aren't based on "it's the right thing to do," like the Alex presents for a wealth cap. I recently listened to [this podcast](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/heresthething/episodes/waste-episode), where [[Ron Gonen]], "[[New York City]]'s first 'Recyclying Czar,'" makes it clear we should be aggressively recycling, not because it's "right" or "fair," but because it's a better economically, by a long shot. If we are ever going to convince skeptics to change their minds, great ideas and arguments like this will be key. 

Overall, this essay was a great read, and a really cool take on a tough issue.
