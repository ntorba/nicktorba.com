I recently followed [Noah Pinion](https://twitter.com/Noahpinion) and twitter and started to read some of his work. 

In [Bidenomics, Explained](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/bidenomics-explained), he pins part of his argument for a paradigm shift on a claim I disagree with. In this note, I lay out why I diagree and what that means for his argument.

Here's the claim: "if income tax cuts made people work more, it certainly isn’t apparent in the aggregate data: " accompanied by this image:

*Data from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/B4701C0A222NBEA)* 

Let's get into why I disagree with his claim. 

## Units and Part-Time Workers 
The unit of the graph shown is Millions of hours/Thousands of Persons. There are two ways for this ratio to go down: 
1. Increase hours worked 
2. Increase the number of people working 

I think number 2 is largely responsible for the decreasing trend we see in this graph. 

In this same time period, many more people joined the work force. Specifically, many women working **part time** jobs joined the work force. That is exactly how you decrease the ratio Millions of hours/Thousands of Persons without decreasing number of hours worked. 

That trend can be seen here:

It is important to point out the __slight__ decrease in total hours worked in this graph (say ~29 to ~25). I'd attribute that mostly to the fact that this data includes people from 14-18, whom, on average, have worked less since the early 1900's. 

## Oshan's Argument

Next, I recently read some of [[Oshan Jarrow]]'s work ([Treadmill Effect](https://musingmind.org/essays/treadmill-tendency) and [UBI and the Capitalist Production of Consciousness](https://josephcwells.com/podcast/oshan-jarow)). In those essays, he tells a much different story. According to him, average hours worked clearly declined from 1800-1930. Then, hours worked faced a period of stagnation until the 70/80's, when certain high status jobs started to work **more hours**.

For example, take a look at this graph of full-time, non-agricultural, production workers from 1870 to 2000:

![weekly-hours-full-time-production](../../images/weekly-hours-full-time-production.jpeg)*Data from [our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/work-hours-per-week?country=~USA), only US* 

We see the decline, (especially from 1910-1930), a small jump around World War II, then the stagnation that has held out until today.

Next, looking at data by occupation, we see that many fields have slowly started to work more since ~1970. 

![hours by occupation](../../images/average-daily-hours-of-work-by-occupation-united-states.png)*Data from [our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-daily-hours-of-work-by-occupation-united-states)*

The only occupation that continued on a decreasing trend is Service.

This is when Oshan points out the perception of work had completely flipped. Almost suddenly, it became high status to work 100 hour weeks (think lawyers and investment bankers). 

Lastly, total hours worked has continually increased.  

![total hours worked](../../images/total-hours-worked-fred.png)*Data from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/B4701C0A222NBEA)*

This is more evidence pointing to the idea that the original decreasing trend decrease becuase more people were added to the work force, not because people are working less. 

## What Does this Mean?

In the end, I still agree with many of Noah's points. It is time for a paradigm shift. However, I disagree with the claim I pointed out at the beginning: "if income tax cuts made people work more, it certainly isn’t apparent in the aggregate data."

In fact, I think the better reason to pull back from these policies is precisely because __they might be working__. 

I think it would be best to return to our pre-WWII perspective on work, which was that we wanted to do less of it. Let's put policies in place that keep that interest in mind.
