From what I can tell, Stoicism is all about preparing yourself against worst case scenarios. It is about contemplating on what can happen, building a mindset to handle it, and building skills that can help during it. A Stoic can even benefit from catastrophes because it will help them harden their methods. This feels like almost the definition of being an Antifragile system.
