As Josh Waitzkin describes in [[The Art of Learning]], learning is like hacking your way through a jungle. All directions look the same, you're tired, but there is only one thing to do - keep moving. As a result, you build trails through previously untouched patches, you find important landmarks, and you eventually understand the previously mysterious world that surrounds you.

I like to visualize my knowledge with this metaphor. Through my work, I've built an extensive mental trail system of [[python]] programming, [[machine learning]] and [[kubernetes]]. For fun, I've recently begun building a mental trail system about [[MTB]] and all that it entails. Soon, I hope to begin building trail systems to better understand topics like [[genomics]], [[quantum computing]], and [[wearable technology]].

For now, much of the writing on this site will not be directly related to my established trail systems. Instead, I'm going to explore new and experimental ideas. You will often see my understanding of new ideas grow from my initial knowledge of specific fields, for better or worse.
