## Welcome to Top of Mind 

Here I will keep track of the topics that have caught my attention recently. This is one of my best procrastination tools. When I don't want to work on one, I just fall down the list until I find a topic I want to read more about. Sometimes this is a detriment, but sometimes it works out great (it just makes it hard to actually finish a piece of writing - you know, the last 10% is the hardest part).
