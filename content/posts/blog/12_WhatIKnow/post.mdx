- I want to create more Living Document style pages outlining topics I am learning and am familiar with
- These won't be tutorials, they will be more of a Reference, a way for me to outline the most important elements of these different tools, languages, and frameworks in a way that makes sense for me
- I should be able to visit these posts whenever I know I have encountered a problem before and have a good likelihood of having written it down. This will include things like common syntax mistakes I might make, forgotten git incantations, or the different ways to center something in CSS. 
- I also want to eventually integrate my Anki solution into the things I have written here to integrate what I know into my memory a bit better
- I am inspired to do this by the numerous other folks who regularly teach topics as they learn them ([Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/learn), [Jason Lengstorf](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/) among others), posted their notes publicly ([Nat Eliason](https://www.nateliason.com/notes), [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/)), and otherwise spread the gospel of learning in public (folks like [David Perell](https://www.perell.com/blog/why-you-should-write) and [swyx](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public))
- There will likely be a number of mostly empty posts going up, I want to get a framework in place now, and build it up as I go.
