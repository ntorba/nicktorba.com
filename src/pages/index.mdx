# Welcome

I'm Nick Torba. For fun, I moutain bike. For work, I software engineer. In general, I live a happy and healthy life. 

With inspiration from many others online, I decided to build [[[The Jungle]]](/brain). My goals are to 
* Connect with other people interested in similar topics
* Better understand my ideas by writing about them and finding connections 
* Improve my writing and note-taking 

Please explore [[[The Jungle]]](/brain) and all of the notes in it by clicking on any text surrounded by double brackets (like this one: [[[The Jungle]]](/brain)).

 I hope you find something interesting.
