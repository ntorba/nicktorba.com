# Welcome

I'm Nick Torba. This is my Online Home. 

With inspiration from many others online, I decided to build [[[The Jungle]]](/brain). My goals are to 
* Make connections with others 
* Better understand my ideas through writing
* Improve my writing and note-taking 


# What is The Jungle?
As Josh Waitzkin describes in [[[The Art of Learning]]](/brain/the-art-of-learning), learning is like hacking your way through a jungle. All directions look the same, you're tired, but there is only one thing to do - keep moving. As a result, you build trails through previously untouched patches, you find important landmarks, and you eventually understand the previously mysterious world that surrounds you. 

I like to visualize my knowledge with this metaphor. Through my work, I've built an extensive mental trail system of [[[python]]](/brain/python) programming, [[[machine learning]]](/brain/machine-learning) and [[[kubernetes]]](/brain/kubernetes). For fun, I've recently begun building a mental trail system about [[[MTB]]](/brain/mtb) and all that it entails. Soon, I hope to begin building trail systems to better understand topics like [[[genomics]]]((/brain/genomics)), [[[quantum computing]]](quantum-computing), and [[[wearable technology]]]((/brain/wearable-technology)). 

For now, much of the writing on this site will not be directly related to my established trail systems. Instead, I'm going to explore new and experimental ideas. You will often see my understanding of new ideas grow from my initial knowledge of specific fields, for better or worse. 

## How it works 
This site is built using a gatsby plugin built by [Aengus Mcmillin](https://aengusmcmillin.com/) that was inspired by the networked note-taking designed used by tools like [[RoamResarch]] and [[Obsidian]]. 

At the bottom of each page, you'll see a section titled **"Linked References"**. This a list of all other notes that reference your current note. **Pages link to other pages based on text enclosed in double brackets** (which you've seen a few of by now). Click on them to go to that note. 

My hope for this site is to leave readers with a bunch of open tabs and new connections.

## Where to Start? 
Check out [[[The Jungle]]](/brain). On that page, I break down of my favorite notes into a few different categories that are great places to start exploring.
